## The LEGO® Toypad

The LEGO® Toypad was originally delivered with the LEGO® Dimensions game. It is a multi NFC reader/writer with a variety of RGB LED features. The pad has three different areas. On the left and right sides, there are three slots each to detect tags. The middle area has only one slot but can also write to the tag.

The LEDs can be customized in all three areas, allowing for the full range of RGB colors. The pad also supports several LED effects like fading and blinking.

Unfortunately, there is a technical limitation: the library only supports the non-Xbox versions of the pad. Look for pads with the FCC-ID ending in 61482. The Xbox pad ends with 61480.

## Tags

As far as I can see, the pad is able to read most modern NFC tag formats. You can, of course, use the original LEGO® Dimensions figures and sockets, but they are very expensive compared to regular NFC tags.

What I did: I bought a bunch of round 4x4 bricks, placed an NFC sticker at the bottom, and put regular LEGO® minifigures on top. You can get all of these directly from LEGO ([link below](https://www.lego.com/de-de/search?q=minifiguren)) or from an alternative brick manufacturer ([link below](https://minifigs.me/pages/minifig-builder)).

## Full Plate

The pad comes with only two small 2x2 connectors on top. If you want to build more structures on top of the pad, you need to buy another plate with the part number 18601.

## Where to Buy

If you want to buy your own device or some of the original LEGO figures, it makes sense to look at some platforms where you can buy used LEGO items. Please make sure you buy a non-Xbox device (3000061482).

If you want to build your own figures, here are some sources. To build your own sockets, it makes sense to use a round 4x4 brick with an NFC sticker on the bottom side:
